# **WHAT IS GIT?**
Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When developers create something (an app, for example),***they make  
        constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release***.ions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.
                  
Git is the preferred version control system of most developers, since it has multiple advantages over the other systems available. It stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.

No coding necessary
To complete this tutorial, you need a ***GitHub.com*** account and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).
