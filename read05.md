## 1-Expressions and operators

 **This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.**

 JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:

#### operand1 operator operand2
#### For example, 3+4 or x*y.

#### A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator:

#### operator operand
####or

####operand operator
####For example, x++ or ++x.


## 2-Loops and iteration
**Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. This chapter of the JavaScript Guide introduces the different iteration statements available to JavaScript.**

**You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another.**
#### For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be  for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
####// Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
####console.log('Walking east one step');
####}
**There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)**

**The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.**
