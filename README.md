## What Having a ***“Growth Mindset”*** Actually Means?
I already have it, and I always have. People often confuse a growth mindset with being flexible or open-minded or with having a positive outlook — qualities they believe they’ve simply always had. My colleagues and I call this a false growth mindset. Everyone is actually a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets, and that mixture continually evolves with experience. A **pure** growth mindset doesn’t exist, which we have to acknowledge in order to attain the benefits we seek.
A growth mindset is just about praising and rewarding effort. This isn’t true for students in schools, and it’s not true for employees in organizations. In both settings, outcomes matter. Unproductive effort is never a good thing. It’s critical to reward not just effort but learning and progress, and to emphasize the processes that yield these things
**### such as: ###**
- seeking help from others.
- trying new strategies.
- capitalizing on setbacks to move forward effectively. 
> In all of our research, the outcome **— the bottom line —** follows from deeply engaging in these processes
