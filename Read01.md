# **A Bout GetHub Pages And Markdwan** 

 ## ***WHAT IS GETHUB PAGES***
 itHub Pages is a service that turns Markdown files into a website and hosts them for free on the internet. If you know how to use GitHub and you need to create a simple webpage, you can’t do better than GitHub Pages. Just create:
 - a new repository on GitHub.
 - commit the Markdown files .
 - enable the GitHub Pages fe.ature.

GitHub Pages uses the Jekyll static site generator to create your website, and the Markdown support is excellent. You can pick one of GitHub’s pre-made themes for your website, use a Jekyll theme, or use your own custom CSS. Shown below is a sample webpage using one of GitHub’s pre-made themes.
 
Confusingly, GitHub Pages renders Markdown differently than GitHub does. GitHub uses its own Markdown processor; GitHub Pages uses jekyll-commonmark. This means your README.md file will look different on GitHub’s website than on your GitHub Pages website. **For example:**
#### emoji are rendered on GitHub’s website, but not on websites generated using GitHub Pages.

## ***WHAT IS MARKDOWN***

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.
To format text with HTML, you put tags around the text. For example, if you want to bold text, you type “<b> this is some bold text </b>”.

When your web browser “reads” a web page, it interprets the HTML tags and applies the relevant formatting. When it sees “<b> this is some bold text </b>”, it understands that anything between the <b> and </b> tags should appear in bold. The browser also hides the tags (<b> and </b>),While in Markdown a tag (**) can be used instead: **My name Aya**, while in HTML it is: 
<b>my name Aya</b>.
In short, Markdown makes it easier to format text for web pages because its tags are simpler than HTML, and they convert to HTML automatically. This means you don’t have to know HTML to write something for a web page because Markdown translates your tags into HTML for you.
